                <h3>The Lying Shepherd</h3>
                <p id="folktale-content">
                    Once upon a time there was a shepherd with his sheep. As they were on the grassland and the sheep
                    were
                    grazing the shepherd started to feel bored. Eventually he decided to trick some people from the near
                    village by shouting loudly: "Help, help, am being attacked by wolves, somebody help!". After some
                    short
                    time, some of the village inhabitans were running to that grassland. Suddenly the shepherd bursted
                    into
                    laughter and told them that it was only a joke. Of course the inhabitants were very angry but they
                    just
                    left the place.
                    The next day it was just the same thing again: the shepherd was shepherding the sheep and after some
                    time starting to feel bored and he shouted for help again. And again after a few minutes, some of
                    the
                    people from the village arrived for help. The shepherd started to laugh out loud and told them that
                    it
                    was only a joke
                    Toad hopped back to the water jar, washed again, then hopped back to the table, and was ready to
                    reach
                    out for some food from one of the platters when Grasshopper stopped him: "Please don't put your
                    dirty
                    paws into the food. Go and wash them again."
                    Toad was furious. "You just don't want me to eat with you!" he cried. "You know very well that I
                    must
                    use my paws and forelegs in hopping about. I cannot help it if they get a bit dirty between the
                    water
                    jar and the table."
                    Grasshopper responded, "You are the one who started it yesterday. You know I cannot rub my forelegs
                    together without making noise."
                    From then on, they were no longer friends.<br>
                    <i>Moral:</i> If you wish to have true friendship with someone, learn to accept each other's faults,
                    as
                    well as each other's good qualities.

                <h3>The Chief's Feast</h3>
                <p id="chiefs-feast-content">The chief sent out messengers to announce that he would give a feast and asked that each guest bring
                    one
                    calabash of palm wine. One man wanted to attend very badly but was to stingy to spare a calabash of
                    palm
                    wine.
                    His wife suggested that he buy the wine, but he said, "What?! Spend money so that I can attend a
                    feast
                    that is free? I l
                    He thought to himself, "If hundreds of people were to pour their wine into the chief's pot, could
                    just
                    one calabash of water spoil so much wine?"
                    The day of the feast came. Everyone bathed and dressed in their finest clothes and gathered at the
                    house
                    of the chief. There was music and dancing. Each man, as he entered the chief's compound, poured the
                    contents of his calabash into the chief's large earthen pot. The man also poured his water there and
                    then greeted the chief.
                    When all the guests had arrived, the chief ordered his servants to fill everyone's cup with wine.
                    The
                    man was impatient, because his mouth watered for some sweet palm wine. At the chief's signal, all
                    the
                    gusts put their cups to their lips and were surprised that what they tasted was WATER.
                    Each guest had thought that his ONE calabash of water would not spoil a great pot of good palm wine,
                    and
                    so each one had brought water.<br>
                    <i>Moral:</i> Dont try to play stupid tricks on others you might end up feeling stupid yourself.
